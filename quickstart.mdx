Welcome to Gigue. This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for authorizing Gigue to access your background tools—Gmail, Google Calendar, Slack, and Google Drive—so you can start using your multiplayer AI workspace.

## 1. Initial Login
1. Navigate to [beta.gigue.app](https://beta.gigue.app/).
2. Click **"Sign In With Google"**.
3. Grant permissions to create a user account in our system. This is required for your user profile and workspace settings.

## 2. Connecting Your Tools
Navigate to the **Connections** tab (found at the bottom of the sidebar or in your settings) to link your accounts.

### Connect Gmail, Drive, & Calendar
1. Find the **Gmail** (or Google) integration and toggle it on.
2. Click **"Connect Account"**.

#### Handling the "Verification" Warning
During this phase, you may encounter a screen that says **"Google hasn't verified this app"**. This is expected for our initial testing environment.
1. Click the **"Advanced"** link in the bottom left of the warning.
2. Click **"Go to Gigue (unsafe)"** to proceed to the consent screen.

### Connect Slack
1. Find the **Slack** integration and toggle it on.
2. Follow the Slack authorization flow to sync your channels and messages.

## 3. Scopes & Permissions
Gigue requires these permissions to function as a multiplayer AI workspace:
- **Read/Send Emails**: To triage your inbox and draft replies.
- **Manage Calendar**: To schedule meetings and prepare briefings.
- **View Drive Files**: To allow AI agents to reference your documents for account context.

## 4. Triggering Initial Sync (Alpha Users)
Once connected, your data needs to be synced to your Gigue workspace: 
1. Navigate to the **Back Office** panel.
2. Under **Sync Channels**, select **Source: Gmail** (or Slack) and click **Run**.
3. Repeat for **Ingest Messages** and **Group Conversations** to populate your **Workstreams**.

## 5. Explore Your Workspace
- **Home (Daily Briefing)**: AI-generated briefings on your day and extracted action items.
- **Conversations**: View your multi-channel messages (Slack/Gmail) grouped by topic.
- **Workstreams**: Track deals. Gigue automatically extracts tasks and updates.
- **Unified Search (Cmd + K)**: Find anything across all connected platforms instantly.
