Welcome to Gigue, your multi-player AI workspace. If you're an Account Executive or Sales Leader, this guide will show you how to move from "busy work" to "closing work" using Gigue's core features.

## 1. Choose Your Path
When you first log in, you'll be prompted to set up your workspace. You have two options:

- **Connect Your Accounts (Recommended)**: Securely link your **Gmail**, **Slack**, and **Google Calendar**. Gigue will immediately start indexing your conversations to provide real-time context.
- **Try with Sample Data**: If you're not ready to connect your real tools, choose this to populate your workspace with a pre-built GTM environment including $2M+ in sample pipeline, active workstreams, and AI-generated deal briefs.

## 2. Your First "Morning Briefing"
Gigue's **Briefing Manager** is your first stop every day. It autonomously scans your connected channels to find what matters.
- **Action Items**: See tasks automatically extracted from yesterday's client calls.
- **Pipeline Alerts**: Get notified of stagnant deals or urgent requests.
- **Daily Agenda**: A prioritized view of your meetings, with AI-generated briefings for each attendee.

## 3. Mastering the Omnichannel Inbox
Stop switching between tabs. Gigue consolidates your communication into one intelligently prioritized stream.
- **Contextual Threads**: When you open an email from a prospect, Gigue shows your team's Slack history with that same account in the sidebar.
- **Drafting with "Conversation Manager"**: Click **Draft Response** to have Gigue write a reply. It doesn't just use a template; it uses your actual CRM data and previous thread history to stay accurate.

## 4. Deploying Your Agent Fleet
Navigate to the **Agents Hub** to manage your specialized Manager Agents:
- **Workstream Manager**: Automatically groups scattered messages and tasks into deal-specific buckets.
- **Schedule Manager**: Handles meeting conflicts and generates briefings.
- **Document Manager**: For generating structured content like pricing proposals or product roadmap updates.

## 5. Unified Search (Cmd + K)
Use `Cmd + K` to search across everything. Whether it's a Slack message from 3 months ago, a PDF in your Google Drive, or a note in your CRM—if it's connected to Gigue, it's searchable.
