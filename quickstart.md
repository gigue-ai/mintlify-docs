Welcome to Gigue, your multiplayer AI workspace. Follow these steps to set up your environment and start automating your revenue operations.

## 1. Connect Your Core Tools
Gigue works best when it has access to your existing data. Head to **Settings > Integrations** to connect:
- **Slack**: For unified messaging and team collaboration.
- **HubSpot / Salesforce**: To sync your CRM data and pipeline stages.
- **Google / Outlook Calendar**: To allow AI agents to manage your schedule.

## 2. Set Up Your First Workspace
Workspaces are where your team collaborates on specific deals or projects.
1. Click the **"+" icon** in the left sidebar.
2. Name your workspace (e.g., "Enterprise Sales Q1").
3. Invite your team members using the **Share** button.

## 3. Deploy Your First Proactive Agent
Gigue's AI agents work in the background to handle repetitive tasks.
- Navigate to the **Agents Hub**.
- Select a template, like the **"Meeting Summarizer"** or **"Pipeline Cleanup"** agent.
- Toggle it to **Active**.

## 4. Unified Search
Once your tools are connected, use `Cmd + K` (or `Ctrl + K`) to search across everything: Slack messages, CRM notes, and internal documents—all in one place.
