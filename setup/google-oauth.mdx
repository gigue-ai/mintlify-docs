This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for authorizing Gigue to access your Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive data.

## 1. Initial Login
1. Navigate to [demo.gigue.app](https://demo.gigue.app/).
2. Click **"Sign In With Google"**.
3. Grant permissions to create a user account in our system. This is required for your user profile and workspace settings.

## 2. Connecting Gmail
1. Click the **"Connections"** icon (usually at the bottom of the sidebar or in your profile settings).
2. Find the **Gmail** integration and toggle it on.
3. Click **"Connect Account"**.

### Handling the "Verification" Warning
During the early access/alpha phase, you may encounter a screen that says **"Google hasn't verified this app"**. This is expected for internal testing.
1. Click the **"Advanced"** link in the bottom left of the warning.
2. Click **"Go to Gigue (unsafe)"** to proceed to the consent screen.

## 3. Scopes & Permissions
Gigue requires the following permissions to function as a multiplayer AI workspace:
- **Read/Send Emails**: To triage your inbox and draft replies.
- **Manage Calendar**: To schedule meetings and prepare briefings.
- **View Drive Files**: To allow AI agents to reference your documents for deal context.

Click **"Allow"** on the Google consent screen to finalize the connection.

## 4. Triggering Initial Sync
Once connected, your Gmail messages and Calendar events need to be synced to the Gigue environment. 
1. Navigate to the **Back Office** panel.
2. Under **Sync Channels**, select **Source: Gmail**.
3. Choose **Incremental** sync and click **Run**.
4. Repeat this for **Ingest Messages** and **Group Conversations** to populate your **Workstreams**.

## Troubleshooting
- **Connection Failed**: Ensure you are not already logged into multiple Google accounts in the same browser window.
- **Missing Messages**: If messages aren't appearing in your **Conversations** tab, re-run the "Sync Channels" task in the Back Office.
- **Disconnecting**: You can revoke access at any time through the **Connections** tab or your [Google Account Security settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).
