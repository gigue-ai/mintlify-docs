## Key Operations & Usage Walkthroughs

Gigue is designed to blend seamlessly into your daily revenue workflows. Below is guidance on our most highly leveraged features.

### Automated Catch-Ups for Strategic or "Red" Accounts

When a sales leader or specialist is added to an active deal:

1. Ensure the new team member is assigned to the account in your CRM or tagged in the relevant Gigue Workstream.
2. The **Briefing Manager** automatically detects the new assignment.
3. It compiles a comprehensive history, summarizing previous emails, Slack messages, and CRM notes into a single **Executive Catch-Up Briefing**.
4. The brief is delivered directly to the new team member's workspace, completely eliminating the need for a synchronous catch-up meeting or manually compiled notes.

### Syncing Product Roadmaps or Pricing Changes

When you need to update multiple customers on a new feature or pricing model:

1. **Navigate to the Agents Hub** and select the **Document Manager**.
2. **Upload** or link your new roadmap/pricing source material.
3. Select your **Target Audience** (e.g., "Tier 1 Enterprise Clients").
4. Instruct the Conversation Manager to **draft personalized updates**. The Agent will use each client's CRM history to contextualize the feature/pricing update.
5. **Review** the drafted emails in your centralized inbox. You can verify the confidence scoring and underlying data references before hitting "Send."

### Extracting Actions from Complex Client Threads

When a long email thread results in a list of demands or action items:

1. Open the email thread in your **Omnichannel Inbox**.
2. Click the **AI Insights** button (sparkle icon) above the message.
3. The **Workstream Manager** will scan the text, extract concrete action items, and suggest assignees based on role.
4. Click **Create Tasks** to automatically populate your Integrated Task Management board, instantly moving the conversation into execution.
