## A multiplayer AI workspace for revenue teams

Gigue is a **multiplayer AI workspace**  designed to help go-to-market teams operate with the same precision and leverage that engineers gain from an IDE.

By consolidating messages, CRM data, and task workflows into a single, intelligently prioritized workspace, Gigue transforms revenue operations and enhances productivity by assigning "proactive agents" (LLMs running as background processes) to repetitive tasks. This allows sales professionals to save up to 20+ hours per week and focus on what matters most: strategy, relationship building, and closing deals.

Gigue shaves weeks off long sales cycles and increases win rates for teams by ensuring no lead or opportunity ever falls through the cracks.

**_(Current Release: Version 0.1.1 - Gigue is currently in closed alpha. We are actively onboarding early users to refine product capabilities for our broader market release.)_**
