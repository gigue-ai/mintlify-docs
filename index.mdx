## 1. Executive Summary & Company Background
Gigue Inc. ("gigue") is a **multiplayer AI workspace for revenue teams**—an integrated execution environment designed to help go-to-market teams operate with the same precision and leverage that engineers gain from an IDE.

By consolidating messages, CRM data, and task workflows into a single, intelligently prioritized workspace, Gigue transforms revenue operations. Rather than replacing human insight, Gigue enhances productivity by assigning "proactive agents" (LLMs running as background processes) to repetitive tasks. This allows sales professionals to save up to 20+ hours per week and focus on what matters most: strategy, relationship building, and closing deals.

Designed specifically to reduce sales cycle times and increase win rates for teams selling into the largest enterprise customers, Gigue shaves weeks off long sales cycles. It builds trust and competitive advantage by ensuring no lead or opportunity falls through the cracks, all while maintaining a consistent and professional voice. 

*(Current Release: **Version 0.1.1** - Gigue is currently in closed alpha. We are actively onboarding early users to refine product capabilities for our broader market release.)*

## 5. Key Operations & Usage Walkthroughs

Gigue is designed to blend seamlessly into your daily revenue workflows. Below is guidance on our most highly leveraged features.

### 5.1 Syncing Product Roadmaps or Pricing Changes
When you need to update multiple customers on a new feature or pricing model:
1. **Navigate to the Agents Hub** and select the **Document Manager**.
2. **Upload** or link your new roadmap/pricing source material.
3. Select your **Target Audience** (e.g., "Tier 1 Enterprise Clients").
4. Instruct the Conversation Manager to **draft personalized updates**. The Agent will use each client's CRM history to contextualize the feature/pricing update.
5. **Review** the drafted emails in your centralized inbox. You can verify the confidence scoring and underlying data references before hitting "Send."

### 5.2 Automated Catch-Ups for Strategic or "Red" Accounts
When a sales leader or specialist is added to an active deal:
1. Ensure the new team member is assigned to the account in your CRM or tagged in the relevant Gigue Workstream.
2. The **Briefing Manager** automatically detects the new assignment.
3. It compiles a comprehensive history, summarizing previous emails, Slack messages, and CRM notes into a single **Executive Catch-Up Briefing**.
4. The brief is delivered directly to the new team member's workspace, completely eliminating the need for a synchronous catch-up meeting or manually compiled notes.

### 5.3 Extracting Actions from Complex Client Threads
When a long email thread results in a list of demands or action items:
1. Open the email thread in your **Omnichannel Inbox**.
2. Click the **AI Insights** button (sparkle icon) above the message.
3. The **Workstream Manager** will scan the text, extract concrete action items, and suggest assignees based on role.
4. Click **Create Tasks** to automatically populate your Integrated Task Management board, instantly moving the conversation into execution.

## 6. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using Gigue, consult the steps below:
- **Missing CRM Data/Sync Delays**: Check the "Integrations" tab in your settings. Ensure your CRM connector (e.g., Salesforce, Hubspot) shows a "Connected" status. If an error is shown, click "Re-authenticate."
- **AI Suggested Actions Not Appearing**: Ensure the "Proactive Agents" toggle is enabled in your workspace settings. If a specific thread isn't generating actions, the AI may have a low confidence score. You can manually prompt the Workstream Manager to force a review.
- **Messages Not Showing in Omnichannel Inbox**: Verify your Gmail or Slack integration status. Background syncs happen in real-time; if delayed, check the Admin Backoffice "Operations Monitor" or contact your system administrator.
